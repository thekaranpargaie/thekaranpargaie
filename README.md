## 🚀 About Me

From playing games and watching movies to building my own digital universe, my fascination with computers knows no bounds. Programming isn't just a skill; it's the medium through which I craft my world, on my terms.

Now, it's time to give back. I'm on a mission to set new standards that solve problems optimally for future generations.

## 💡 My Vision

Everything I create is open-sourced.  
Join me in building a future where technology serves as a foundation for a billion dreams.
